### Introduction Assignment

Hello, my name is Matthew McCafferty. I am taking this course to understand programming better and to feel more comfortable using R/RStudio, and Github. Understanding data science will be an important part of my career, and I want to learn more about the processes. I hope to become more educated on the subject and hopefully use some of the skills learned in this course throughout my career.  


My data science experience is limited to ESM206 data analysis. Other than ESM206, I have had no formal data science experience. I dealt with data for my last job, but primarily through excel, and it was not a lengthy amount of data. My limited experience in data science is the primary reason I am taking this course.
